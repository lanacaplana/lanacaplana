We live in a post-pandemic world, when people faced and went through the unprecedented change in the world of work. It had a tremendous effect on their working lives. Coming to the office and meeting people in person appeared no longer to be a norm. On top of that, massive workforce migration caused by the war in Ukraine made lots of businesses face an urgent need to manage their chaotically dispersed workforce to survive. For them a remote work mode seems to be not a privilege or necessity anymore but rather a new reality. So what do we know about remote work?

Many managers still require their employees to come to an office voicing their concerns of team productivity and retention or caring of already-set work processes. Well, those hesitant can learn from the SAP experience. With its 100,000 employees worldwide, it was one of the first digital companies to implement remote work ‘as a norm’ following their lockdown experience. With this decision, they demonstrated a high level of trust and concern to their personnel, as the internal polls showed up to 90% of staff would prefer to return to the office after the pandemic risks diminish.
