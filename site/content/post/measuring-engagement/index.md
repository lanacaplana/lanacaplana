Managers often face a need to quantify people-related data when it comes to measuring employee happiness and other psychological states predicting productivity and well-being. The most commonly used measure in scientific literature recommended by the trustworthy HR institutions, such as CIPD, is Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES). Unlike other measures, this one proved by the research to have positive relationships with organisational and task performance, customer satisfaction, productivity, innovation, staff retention, efficiency and health and safety performance. 

What is Work Engagement 

Work Engagement is also called task or job engagement, focuses specifically on a psychological state experienced by employees during work. It has 3 dimensions:

vigour - energy, resilience and effort put in work
dedication - enthusiasm, inspiration and pride of work
absorption - concentration and real interest in work

It is also seen as the antithesis to burnout – an exhaustion and cynicism associated with chronic stress at work.

How to measure Work Engagement

The UWES methodology is easy to use, following the next steps:

1. Using pre-defined UWES statements, HR prepares and conducts questionnaire.

Usually called as 'Work and wellbeing survey' to avoid answering bias related to the definition of 'work engagement,, it includes 17,  9 or 3 statements. The original measure is 17-item (UWES-17). Later shortened 9-item (UWES-9), and ‘ultra-short’ 3-item version (UWES-3) were produced and proved to be the reliable and valid indicators. 

Thus, 3-item UWES version includes the following statements:   

I feel bursting with energy at my work (vigour)
I am enthusiastic about my job (dedication)
I am immersed in my work (absorption)

2. It takes up to 5 minutes for a respondent to reply. 

An employee evaluates each of UWES statements using the scale 0-6, which represents how often they experience a feeling of engagement at work. 

0 - Never
1- A few times a year or less
2 - Once a month or less
3 - A few times a month
4 - Once a week
5 - A few times a week
6 - Every day

3. The scores get analysed and interpreted based on methodology. 

Results show the work engagement levels for each respondent and for a team in general. UWES comes up with three subscale scores for each of the mentioned above dimensions, that obviously ranges between 1 and 6, and a total score. In order to interpret the scores, the mean score from the database is used. The database is available for a number of countries worldwide, including statement templates in different languages.

4. Having this results as a baseline, managers can use the predictors of work engagement to plan people management activities that influence how happy they feel at work.

Example
Below are the results of UWES-3 evaluation, that is calculated as the average of scores provided by each employee evaluating three of the mentioned above UWES-3 statements:

Vigour: 5.2
Dedication: 4.5
Absorption: 4.1

The Total Score is 4.7, and calculated as the average of scores on three UWES subscales.

In order to interpret the scores, the mean score from the UWES-3 database is used:
M 3.74
E 0.01
SD 1.17

As we can see, UWES-3 score for this team is far above the mean (3.74). Therefore, this team is highly engaged and high levels of job satisfaction, productivity, innovation, staff retention, efficiency and health and safety performance can be anticipated for this group in the given period. Managers can use this data to reflect on which components of people management they want to understand, prioritise and leverage in the future. 

To conclude, UWES methodology is used to evaluate work engagement as the most common construct and measure in scientific research. It gives the strongest evidence base, includes valid factors or drivers to leverage, scientifically proven to predict performance, and valid cross-culturally. With a little training to implement and use in house by HR team and people managers, UWES can be used as the valid tool to plan people-related activities in order to leverage employee happiness and other psychological states predicting productivity and retention.
