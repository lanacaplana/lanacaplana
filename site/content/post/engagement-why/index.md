Employee engagement is a buzzword that you may have heard thrown around in HR circles, but what exactly does it mean? Simply put, employee engagement refers to the level of emotional commitment and dedication that an employee has towards their job and the organisation they work for. [Research has shown](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-growth.aspx) that employee engagement is a key driver of business success. Engaged employees are more productive, more likely to stay with their organisation, and are more likely to provide exceptional customer service.

### Benefits of employee engagement 

First and foremost, engaged employees are **more productive**. When employees are emotionally invested in their work, they are more likely to put in the extra effort needed to achieve exceptional results. This increased productivity can have a significant impact on the bottom line, helping organisations to achieve their goals and stay ahead of the competition. 

In addition to increased productivity, employee engagement is also closely linked to **reduced turnover** rates. When employees feel engaged and connected to their organisation, they are more likely to stay with the company long-term. This can help reduce the costs associated with hiring and training new employees, while also ensuring that the organisation maintains a strong, knowledgeable workforce. 

Engaged employees are also more likely to be **innovative and creative** in their work, which can lead to new ideas, products, and services. They are also more likely to provide exceptional customer service, which can help build customer loyalty and improve the overall reputation of the organisation. Additionally, engaged employees tend to have better relationships with their colleagues and managers, which can create a positive work environment and boost overall morale.

In conclusion, employee engagement is a critical factor in driving business success. By fostering an environment where employees feel connected, valued, and engaged, organisations can reap the benefits of increased productivity, reduced turnover rates, and a stronger, more dedicated workforce. So, if you're looking to take your organisation to the next level, it's time to start prioritising employee engagement!
