Depending on the type of business, specialised discipline and business KPIs one can apply different approaches to measure productivity in a remote context. 

In structured and systematic UN context, when robust performance management - SMART goal setting, annual appraisals, feedback culture - is in place, accompanied with the defined approach to team management, such as project management and organisational maturity standards, planning and monitoring of project results help to keep up on the priorities and diligently report on the project results. In contrast, the IT outsource company, ould require time logging and Jira task management and Agile projects management to monitor productivity and provide clients with the valid data. 

Although the productivity evaluation tools [vary significantly](https://remote.co/qa-leading-remote-companies/how-do-you-measure-productivity-of-remote-workers/), I would highlight several principles for [monitoring and managing teleworkers](https://remote.co/4-proven-remote-productivity-monitoring-and-management-strategies/):

1. trusting your employees that they would do their best to meet the business goals. We can put in place measures of work engagement and motivation to evaluate people's experiences at the workplace
2. building a result-oriented culture focusing on productivity rather than hours and accountability for results
3. ensuring you have a robust performance management system in place, including goals setting, feedback giving, prioritising and regular progress tracking
