Working as an HR Business Partner both in the United Nations and Technology Industry, I met many outstanding leaders and effective teams. All of them were well-educated and highly-skilled, demonstrating compelling professional competencies, ideally matching the culture of their organisations. However, some of them were more successful than others. 

Obviously, employees with high quality jobs and professional managers are happier, healthier and better fulfilled, driving productivity, better quality of goods and level of services, as well as boosting innovation. The question is what should a manager do to reach such results? 

## A recent research revealed 5 line manager behaviours supporting health, wellbeing and engagement:

### Be open, fair and consistent:
* take a positive approach while interacting with people, at any cost avoid direct criticism and never blame people for their mistakes,
* treat people with respect, coaching them and being attentive to their point of view,
* consider your emotional intelligence, manage emotions and stay calm under pressure,
* be consistent and fair, demonstrate impartiality, integrity and kindness in all circumstances.

### Handle conflicts effectively:
* when facing the conflict, deal with it immediately and impartially, follow up as appropriate,
* provide people with support they need to perform their jobs effectively, never tolerate inappropriate behaviours, such  as bullying or harassment,
* be prepared to request support to yourself or your colleagues, when needed, using organisations resources wisely.
 
### Provide clarity and guidance:
* show understanding of your own and employees’ roles, 
* clarify your expectations and provide clear feedback, 
* give advice and guidance when needed, making time for people, 
* be decisive, following up on action points and taking responsibility for problem-solving.

### Build and maintain relationships:
* show empathy, concern and consideration for employees, taking an interest in their lives, 
* communicate with employees in a friendly and sociable way, 
* be available and provide opportunities for employees to speak one-to-one. 

### Support development:
* take time to discuss employees’ career development and actively support them to develop,
* offer opportunities and arrange career progression and development for employees.

Reflect on your own behaviours and devote 10 minutes a day practising, so to become an outstanding leader managing a successful and engaged team.
