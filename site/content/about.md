### Who I am

My Name is Svitlana Orlova. I am an HR Professional, helping managers to lead their teams gracefully.

I strongly believe that all the business activities and results come down to interaction between a leader and a group. The success of that interaction - robust trust, high productivity and retention, clear understanding of business goals - depends on the quality of relationships managers can build with their teams.

### What I do

As an HR Professional, I understand how effective management and leadership looks like. I also see people issues and partner with business leaders to overcome those issues, advising on relevant models, tools, people data, and thus, help them to become outstanding leaders.

### What to expect

I know that grace is a top quality of outstanding leaders. Graceful people are empathetic and elegant. They care about others and treat them with respect and dignity. They move gently towards their goals, embracing all challenges in a noble and ethical manner. They succeed often.

My blog is about effective and ethical people management approaches for those who want to be an outstanding leader!
